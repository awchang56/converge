Creating an event for something so wildly diverse and rapidly evolving is an impossible task, but we attempt it anyway. And we do it with excitement, because we believe that online video is the most important cultural force since the motion picture. We are in the very early, defining moments of an extremely powerful global force. VidCon is and strives to continue to be the physical center of that revolution",
